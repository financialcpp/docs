The easiest way to try out **financialcpp** is to use the batteries-included starter template.

## Installation

Create from template:

<code-group>
  <code-block label="NPX" active>

  ```bash
  # Make sure you have npx installed (npx is shipped by default since NPM 5.2.0) or npm v6.1 or yarn.
  npx create-financialcpp <project-name>
  ```

  </code-block>
  <code-block label="NPM">

  ```bash
  # Starting with npm v6.1 you can do:
  npm init create-financialcpp <project-name>
  ```

  </code-block>
</code-group>

The template will take care of installing packages.

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see the following in your console:

```bash
ðŸš€ Server started at http://localhost:3000
```

There's much more to learn but you can open your browser at the address and get familiar with the interface.
